# Fruit_Classification
The Following Project Is On The Fruit 360 Dataset, The Intention Is To Classify Fruits And Vegetables Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms

Uses Flask For The UI and Tensorflow For Training The Data.

Next Implimintations Will Include:
  Fine Tuning For Better Accuracies
  Trying Different Activations
  Object Detection
  Apply Image Processing Techniques

Looking Into: SVM, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor and ANN for Next Algorithm to Test.
