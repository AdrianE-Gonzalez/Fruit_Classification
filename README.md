# Fruit_Classification
The Following Project Is On The Fruit 360 Dataset, The Intention Is To Classify Fruits And Vegetables Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms

Next Implimintations Will Include:
  Fine Tuning For Better Accuracies
  Trying Different Activations
  Object Detection
  Apply Image Processing Techniques

Looking Into: SVM, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor and ANN for Next Algorithm to Test.
Uses Flask For The UI and Tensorflow For Training The Data.
